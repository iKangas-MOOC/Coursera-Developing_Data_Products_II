## Body Mass Index

- The body mass index (BMI), or Quetelet index, is a measure of relative size based on the mass and height of an individual.
<br />
<br />
- The index was devised by Adolphe Quetelet.
<br />
<br />
- The BMI of an individual can be used as a simple method to assess how much the recorded body weight departs from what is healthy or desirable for a person of that height.

## BMI Calculator
- We provide an app where the user inputs his height and weight and he/she finds out the according BMI.
<br />
- The BMI for a person is defined as their body mass divided by the square of their height. 
<br />
- Thus, it is given by the following equation: $$\LARGE \frac{mass}{height^2} $$
- The calculation in R is performed as:
```{r,eval=FALSE}
bmi <- weight/(height**2)
```
- Note: The unit of mass is kilograms (kg) and the unit of height is meter (m)

## Results

- In most cases, users are not able to interpret the index.
<br />
<br />
- In addition to BMI, the category into which the user falls, is shown. Some example categories are:

      BMI         |               Category
------------------|--------------------------------------
from 15.0 to 16.0 | Severely underweight
from 18.5 to 25   | Normal (healthy weight)
over 40           | Obese Class III (Very severely obese)

<br />
- Finally, a recommendation message is displayed to the user based on his/hers category.
